# Wordle Solver

A solver for Wordle or termo.oo. Includes a tester class for testing different algorithms. Both Wordle and Termo.oo have a set of words (containing around 10000 words) that one can input. However, they only pick solutions from a smaller set of solutions (~1000-2000 words) that can be picked as solutions.
